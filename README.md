# NetworkLogger 📡

An Android application for real-time telecom network and device monitoring. It captures cell tower parameters, GPS location, signal strength, and device health metrics — saving everything as CSV files directly in the phone's Downloads folder.

> Developed for academic and research purposes at **IIT Delhi**

**Language:** Kotlin  
**Platform:** Android (Min SDK 24 · Target SDK 36)

## Motivation

Existing Android network monitoring tools often have one or more of the following limitations:

- Require rooted devices to function
- Show only live values without continuous logging
- Do not combine telecom and device health information together
- Do not generate structured datasets suitable for research
- Are expensive professional tools (like Nemo or TEMS) unavailable to students

NetworkLogger was developed to solve these problems — providing a free, lightweight Android app that generates structured telecom datasets using only Android's public APIs, on any phone, without requiring root access.

---

## What the App Does

NetworkLogger runs two independent logging systems simultaneously:

**Foreground Logging (manual)**  
The user taps **START LOGGING** and the app records network + GPS data every 5 seconds into `network_logs.csv`.

**Background Logging (automatic)**  
A background worker runs every 15 minutes automatically — even when the app is closed — saving device health data into `background_logs.csv`.

Both files are saved to `/storage/emulated/0/Download/` and are immediately visible in the phone's Files app without any special access.

The app works on both **rooted and non-rooted** Android devices. Root access is not required.

## Permissions Explained

| Permission | Why it is needed |
|------------|-----------------|
| `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` | Required by Android to call `allCellInfo` and get GPS coordinates |
| `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION` | Fallback location permission |
| `READ_PHONE_STATE` | Required to read network type, operator name, and cell tower parameters |
| `FOREGROUND_SERVICE` | Required to run WorkManager as a foreground service |
| `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_DATA_SYNC` | Foreground service type declaration — mandatory on Android 14+ |
| `REQUEST_IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATIONS` | Requests exemption so background worker is not killed by the OS |

> **Why does the app say "make and manage phone calls"?**  
> `READ_PHONE_STATE` is grouped under Android's "Phone" permission category. Android shows this generic label for the entire group. The app **cannot** make calls, access call history, or interact with phone calls in any way. It only uses this permission to read cell tower signal data.

---

## Root Detection

The app detects rooted devices using 7 independent methods. If any method fires, the device is marked as Rooted with a red badge.

| Method | What it checks |
|--------|---------------|
| `checkSuBinaries()` | 12 filesystem paths for `su` binary |
| `checkRootPackages()` | 12 known root manager packages (Magisk, SuperSU, KingRoot, etc.) |
| `checkBuildTags()` | `Build.TAGS` system property for `test-keys` string |
| `checkDangerousProps()` | System properties: `ro.debuggable=1`, `ro.secure=0`, `ro.build.type=eng` |
| `checkRWPaths()` | `/system` mounted read-write via `mount` command output |
| `checkRootCloakingApps()` | Xposed Framework, RootCloak, HideMyRoot, Substrate packages |
| `tryExecuteSu()` | Executes `su -c id` and checks output for `uid=0` — most reliable check |

Root access is **not required** for the app to function. All features work identically on non-rooted devices.

---

## Known Behaviours

### Cell Info: Not Available (brief flicker)
`telephonyManager.allCellInfo` returns an empty list during the modem's internal refresh cycle. The app shows "Cell Info: Not Available" for one 5-second cycle then automatically recovers. Data is not lost — the previous valid values are still saved in that CSV row.

### SINR shows N/A on 4G phones
SINR is a 5G NR-only parameter. Android does not expose it for LTE connections by design. This is expected and correct.

### Background worker timing is irregular for first 2 cycles
WorkManager enforces a 15-minute minimum but the first couple of cycles may run slightly early due to the `OneTimeWorkRequest` overlapping with the `PeriodicWorkRequest`. This normalizes after the first two runs.

### Background logging stops at low battery
On Realme, OPPO, OnePlus, and Xiaomi phones, the OS aggressively kills background processes when battery drops to approximately 20%. This is a phone OS restriction. Enable **No Restrictions** in battery settings and enable **Autostart** for NetworkLogger to minimize this.

### Rooted OnePlus / Android 14
Android 14 enforces strict `foregroundServiceType` declaration. The app handles this by declaring `foregroundServiceType="dataSync"` in the manifest and passing `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_DATA_SYNC` to `ForegroundInfo` on API 34+.

## Problems Solved During Development

| Problem | Root Cause | Fix Applied |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| CSV files invisible in Files app | `getExternalFilesDir()` saves to hidden sandboxed folder on Android 10+ | Migrated to `MediaStore.Downloads` API |
| New CSV file created on every 5-second cycle | `IS_PENDING = 1` hid the file from subsequent MediaStore queries | Removed `IS_PENDING`; added `IS_PENDING = 0` filter to all queries |
| RSRQ and SINR always N/A on 5G | Was reading `csiRsrq` / `csiSinr`; modems only report SS fields | Changed to `ssRsrq` / `ssSinr` with CSI as fallback |
| Background worker not running on release APK | OEM battery optimization kills WorkManager silently | Added foreground service notification + battery exemption |
| App crash on rooted OnePlus (Android 14) | `InvalidForegroundServiceTypeException` — mandatory on Android 14 | Declared `foregroundServiceType="dataSync"` in manifest + `ForegroundInfo` service type |
| App crash on launch (rooted phone, Android 12+) | `PhoneStateListener` blocked by root security framework | Replaced with `TelephonyCallback` for API 31+; kept `PhoneStateListener` for older |
| GPS coordinates not updating while moving | `lastLocation` returns cached position | Switched to `getCurrentLocation()` for fresh fix each cycle |
| Signal label stuck on "Weak" at -113 dBm | Used Android's generic 0-4 level instead of actual RSRP | Built `getRsrpSignalLabel()` using standard RSRP thresholds |
| Background worker `SignalLevel` always N/A | `allCellInfo` returns empty if modem hasn't refreshed | Added `requestCellInfoUpdate()` + 300ms wait before reading |
| `background_logs.csv` not created until 15 min after launch | `PeriodicWorkRequest` waits before first run | Added `OneTimeWorkRequestBuilder` to fire worker immediately on launch |

---

## Testing

Tested on the following devices:

| Device | Android | Network | Root | Result |
|--------|---------|---------|------|--------|
| Realme RMX3241 | Android 13 (API 33) | JIO 5G | Non-Rooted | Full 5G data — NCI, RSRQ, SINR, handover captured ✓ |
| Sakshi's phone | Android 13 | Airtel 4G | Non-Rooted | LTE data — MCC/MNC/CID/RSRP/RSRQ captured ✓ |
| OnePlus CPH2487 | Android 14 (API 34) | — | Rooted | App stable after Android 14 foreground service fix ✓ |
| Ma'am's phone | Android — | Airtel 4G | Non-Rooted | Data collected; stopped at ~20% battery (OS restriction) |

**Real data observed (JIO 5G, Delhi):**
- Cell handover captured: PCI 529 → 574 → 385
- RSRP range: -93 to -113 dBm
- RSRQ: -3 to -12 dB
- SINR: 0 to 15 dB
- Neighbor cells: 4 to 6 simultaneously visible
- GPS accuracy: 28–40 metres

## Future Scope

- **Coverage heatmap** — overlay GPS + RSRP on a map to visualize signal across a route
- **Cloud synchronization** — auto-upload CSV to Google Drive or Firebase
- **Network quality score** — estimate MOS from RSRP / RSRQ / SINR
- **Multi-device aggregation** — collect and compare data from multiple phones simultaneously
- **Excel / chart export** — auto-generate graphs from logged data
- **Signal drop alerts** — notify when RSRP falls below a configurable threshold
- **Operator benchmarking** — compare JIO vs Airtel vs Vi on the same route
